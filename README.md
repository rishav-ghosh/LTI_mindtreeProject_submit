ðŸ§  Brain Scan AI â€” Alzheimerâ€™s Disease classification

This project focuses on detecting and classifying Alzheimerâ€™s disease from MRI brain scans using deep learning pre-trained models automated MLOps tools.
It integrates a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with a Flask web application to provide real-time predictions and automated deployment pipelines

The system classifies MRI images into four stages of Alzheimerâ€™s disease:

ðŸŸ¢ Non-Demented

ðŸŸ¡ Very Mild Dementia

ðŸŸ  Mild Dementia

ðŸ”´ Moderate Dementia

The model uses transfer learning on pre-trained CNN architectures to achieve high accuracy.
For deployment, the project implements Git, DVC, Jenkins, and Docker for continuous integration and versioned model management.
